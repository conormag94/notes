# Notes for my personal wiki application

Pushes will trigger webhook to [personal-wiki](https://github.com/conormag94/personal-wiki)

Categories can be added by putting the note in a folder, **e.g.** `git/some-note.md`

**Some sample code**
```
class Foo(object):
    def bar(self):
        self.baz = "Hello World" * 5
        print(self.baz)
```
